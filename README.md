## Overview

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze key business metrics such as sales, profit, discounts, and geographical performance. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into business performance across multiple dimensions, including time, product segments, and geographical regions.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: The dashboard contains various types of visualizations like treemaps, stacked bar charts, clustered column charts, line charts, and more, allowing users to explore data from different perspectives.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Slicers for year, month, segment, country, and product are included to enable drill-downs and focused analysis.
- **Drill-Through Capability**: Users can drill through from a higher level (e.g., segment) to detailed product-level performance analysis.
